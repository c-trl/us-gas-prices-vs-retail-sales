###Comparing US average gas prices to US retail and food service sales

The price of oil has been declining for quite a while now, and I woud be betraying my undergraduate studies if I didn't keep up with at least watching it in the news.  Obviously my curiousity would never let me keep it at that, so I'm going to put my new-found abilities to keep a journal on what I find relative to the declining prices at the gas pump.  One time in 2010 I took a picture of a gas pump that showed the price of $2.99 a gallon.  Back then I was surprised to see gas fall below the $3.00 mark.  

Some explorations I'd like to make before I abandon this notebook:
  - Explore the short-sightedness (or ignorance, depending on how misanthropic your are) of consumer behavior.  I've read claims about SUV sales being surprisingly gas-price-elastic, even amidst a growing support for hybrid/electric cars.  Counter-arguments included the increasing fuel-efficiency of SUVs and larger vehicles in general.  What caught my attention were claims of just how sensitive SUV sales are to gas prices; at the sight of dropping gas prices, consumers begin choosing SUVs.  This implies that consumers expect gas prices to keep declining - or at least stay low.  THIS concept would not surprise me, although it would be nice to find proof in numbers.
  - Explore other variables relative to changes in gas prices, such as utility prices, ecommerce industry performance, and savings habits among consumers.
